## Move

The distance that a cap can move within a turn is influenced by its
speed skill.

## Pass

The pass range of a cap is influenced by the pass skill.

The angle of the pass cone of a cap is influenced by the talent skill.

The pass range is limited by the presence of a rival cap in the pass cone.

A pass is attempted from a passing cap to a target point.

An ongoing pass has a green zone (near pass) and a red zone (far pass).

If made to the green zone, the ball will arrive to the exact previewed target point.

If made to the red zone, the ball final position will be distorted by an error,
that is larger as the pass is attempted farther.

When the user selects pass, for all rivals, a circle will appear. Its
radio is influenced by the defense skill.
